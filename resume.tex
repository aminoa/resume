\begin{rSection}{EXPERIENCE}
\textbf{New York University}, Brooklyn, NY, {\emph{Teaching Assistant (Machine Learning)}} \hfill Sep 2023 - Present \\
• Instructed 40 students weekly for machine learning topics of written and programming tasks through office hours \\
• Graded weekly assignments on the basis of proper algorithm implementation, code correctness and style 

\textbf {NYU Algorithms and Foundations Group}, Brooklyn, NY, {\emph{Researcher}} \hfill Feb 2023 - Sep 2023 \\
• Designed and implemented a diagonal estimator for a dynamic matrix, Deltagonalshift, based on Hutchinson's diagonal estimator and the DeltaShift trace estimation algorithm under Professor Christopher Musco \newline
% • Demonstrated Deltagonalshift was more effective than repeatedly running Hutchinson's diagonal estimator. \newline
• Developed AdaHessian example via PyTorch to test Deltagonalshift compared to its current diagonal esimator

\textbf{MarketFusion}, Remote, {\emph{Software Engineering Intern}} \hfill July 2022 - Sep 2022 \\
• Developed client-side React.js web application registration and shopping pages for online food delivery service \\
• Facilitated user account creation by sending server requests to internal MySQL database via the Axios library \\
• Revamped login authentication by implementing 4 unique character password checks and a length requirement of 8-20 characters client-side via regular expressions and server-side to aid the security of the website 

\textbf{Corelink}, Brooklyn, NY, {\emph{Software Engineering Intern}}\ \hfill Sep 2021 - May 2022 \\
• Implemented a C++ UDP network packet splitter to enable researchers to bypass Corelink's MTU limit from 20,000 to 64,000 bytes, increasing maximum throughput by 220\% \newline
• Designed Next.js/React interview scheduling platform using Auth0 for authentication and MongoDB backend \newline
% • Guided 3 students as a part of my team, assisting them with their project design and implementation \newline
• Scripted bash memory tests to determine the effectiveness of RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) 

\textbf{Monarc}, Dallas, TX, {\emph{Software Engineering Intern}} \hfill Jun 2021 - Aug 2021 \\
• Developed C\# UWP desktop application pages using MVVM (Model-View View-Model) principles to manipulate a robotic football quarterback to throw balls at 5 placements and distances up to 100 yards \newline
• Devised error checks and boot logging to enable remote debugging, improving the stability of the machine \smallskip
